# **Haskell Lab**

A focused workspace to learn Haskell 


## Learning Plan

![logo](assets/logo.png)


Phase 1: Setup & the basics

- Install Haskell
- Write very simple programs: functions, recursion, lists, pattern matching.
- Use an interactive REPL (GHCi) to experiment.


Phase 2: Core functional programming in Haskell

- Understand immutability, first-class functions, higher-order functions, type inference.
- Learn common abstractions: map/filter/fold, algebraic data types, typeclasses.
- Practice by rewriting algorithms you know (e.g., sorting, graph traversal) in Haskell.

Phase 3: Advanced Haskell features

- Monads, functors, applicative, monad transformers — these are crucial for real Haskell code.
- Lazy evaluation, purity, side-effect modeling (IO, State, etc).
- Learn how Haskell’s type system and abstraction mechanisms support proofs and correctness.
